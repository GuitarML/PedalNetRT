        "##### **Step 1**. Click \"Runtime\" in the Colab top menu bar, then \"Change Runtime Type\" and select \"GPU\" and save. You have a limited number of consecutive GPU hours with the free version of Colab, but this will reset in a day or so. \n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Step 2**. Upload your recorded output from your device by dragging and dropping the \"out.wav\" file to the file browser in the left hand window in Colab. Ensure that this file is named \"out.wav\".\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Step 3**. Run the SETUP ENVIRONMENT section by clicking the run arrow on the top left of the box. Should take a few minutes. Scroll down to next step when finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Step 4**. Choose one (and only one) of the next 3 options as applicable to your captured device. This will begin the model training process. It should take about 12 minutes with GPU runtime selected. You may stop and resume this block if needed, the process will continue where it left off.\n",
        "        \n",
        "##### **Step 5**. Run this section to generate a Smart Pedal compatible model file. Download from the left hand file browser by right clicking the \"newSmartPedal.json\" filename in the left hand menu and selecting \"Download\". May need to refresh the filebrowser by clicking the refresh folder icon.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Step 6**. Optionally, generate a plot of the signals to visually see how close the model is to the actual device. \n",
        "------------\n",
        "**Note**: Recommended to \"Disconnect and delete runtime\" from the \"Runtime\" menu and \"Reconnect\" to reset the environment when training additional models. Make sure to download your trained model before disconnecting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: To continue to refine the model, you may run the same Step 4 (a,b,c) after increasing the \"--max_epochs\" field value. for example, in Step 4c., change \"--max_epochs=1300\" to \"--max_epochs=1400\" to run an additional 100 epochs.  Then re-run Step 5 to generate a new Smart Pedal compatible model. "

        "1.   Training will go through 300 epochs, beginning with a pre-trained starting point model. The \"max_epochs\" field values are much higher due to the previous training of the model. For example, the pre-trained high gain amp model was trained for 1000 epochs, so the max_epochs are set to 1300 in the train.py command to conduct 300 additional epochs of training. The Clean Amp pre-trained model was trained for 2000 epochs so it is set to 2300 by default. This can be adjusted to more or less by changing the value in the \"max_epochs\" field.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   If you are getting NaN/nan for the loss value check that your out.wav file was exported properly. If there is no actual audio in your out.wav you will see NaN/nan for the loss vlaues, and your model will not train.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For ideal amplifier capture, record the direct out signal from a load box. Recommended to use a re-amp device when playing the SmartPedal_Capture.wav out of your audio device for impedence matching. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. If you run out of GPU runtime usage in Colab, add \"--cpu\" flag to the \"train.py\" command to train on the cpu. This will be much slower.\n",
        "\n",
